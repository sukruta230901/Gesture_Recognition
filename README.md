# Gesture_Recognition
## ðŸ“Œ Main Aim 
In this project various gestures and standard sign languages were recognized using OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries of Machine Learning recognition algorithm and they were implemented on the Raspberry Pi's Raspbian OS.

## ðŸš€ Details 
â—¾ The main focus of this project is to provide ease for the verbally mute and hearing-impared people to communicate fluently in their daily chores. This is the base system that can be further expanded to train the standard sign language using raspberry pi. 

â—¾ This system trained a total of 20 standard gestures namely - numbers (from one to nine and zero), just a part, approval, three finger salute, you lost to me, direction, ok, like, play, no, good luck, and done. There are two options provided for user - 1 to train the data and 0 to recognize the data. We implemented this project on raspberry pi 3 by installing the mediapipe and opencv libraries. 

â—¾ It can be implemented using either Thonny IDE or Jupyter Notebook (preferable) in Raspberry Pi. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Contents
This repository contains various sections - 
* **gesture_recog_windows-os.py** - This file is the python source code for the gesture recognition system tested on Jupyter Notebook of Windows OS.
* **gesture_recog_raspberrypi-os.py** - This is the python source code for the gesture recognition system tested on Jupyter Notebook of Raspberry Pi 3 OS i.e. Raspbian OS.
* **gesture_recognition.pkl** - This file is the training data for the standard 20 gestures that we've trained during the implementation of our project.
* **Gesture Recognition Signs** - It is an issue providing the glimpses of the gestures that we've trained. All 20 gestures were recognized and captured by the system.
